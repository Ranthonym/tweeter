# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone built using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX on the front-end, and Node, Express and MongoDB on back-end.

This project implements a stretch goal of adding a scroll to top button that dynamically becomes visible on the bottom right area of the page when the user scrolls down a certain distance. Upon clicking the button, the page will automatically scroll to the top of the page and show the "Compose new Tweet" box.
